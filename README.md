# Notice
When your surface2 fails to start normally due to replacing EFI (***no one will do this,unless you're stupid like me***),
![image](https://github.com/CruedDerio139/SurfaceRT2Repair/blob/main/image.png) you will be very anxious. Then you search
Google for countermeasures and find that no one can help you. At this time, Microsoft's official recovery mode can not enter. Then I think you should try my suggestion.😏


# How to do that
    -Make sure you have an 8GB USB flash drive (USB2.0 is recommended because I have tried it many times to get into recovery mode)

    -Then go to the Microsoft website <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage> and download the image

    -Unzip the image and put it directly into the USB flash drive ![example](https://github.com/CruedDerio139/SurfaceRT2Repair/blob/main/example.png)
- Step 1:	Make sure your Surface is turned off and plugged in.
- Step 2:	Plug the USB recovery drive into the USB port.
- Step 3:	Press and hold the volume down button while pressing and releasing the power button.
- Step 4:	When the Surface logo is displayed, release the volume button.
- Step 5:	When you see the prompt, select the language and keyboard layout you want.
    ___When you're in recovery mode, don't get too excited. If you choose to boot from the drive,___ 🤪, ___you need to change your USB flash drive , otherwise it won't be recognized___
- Step 6:	Select the target operating system that needs to be reset. (This refers to the operating system currently installed on your Surface.) )
- Step 7:	Select Delete only my files or Clean drive completely. The option to clean up the drive is more secure, but it also takes a long time. For example, if you want to recycle your Surface, you should clean up your drive. If you want to keep your Surface, just delete the file.
Step 8:	Select Recovery. Surface restarts and the Surface logo appears as the reset process continues. This may take a few minutes.

* congratulations！🎉🎉🎉

+ Finally, it's time to upgrade your surface to win10.
